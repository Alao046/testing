    <h3>THE FIRST BICYCLE</h3>
    <p>In 1817, Baron invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal garden faster</p>
    <p>The machine became knowm as the draisienne(or "hobby horse), it was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a lad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden</p>
    <h3>FUTHER INNOVATIONS</h3>
    <p>The next appearance was a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel</p>
